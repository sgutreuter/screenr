\description{
A preliminary study was conducted in which a random sample of 5,000 properly
consented unicorns were recruited from 20 clinics.  Each unicorn was asked
six questions about their behavior and health.  Unicorns responded by
stomping a hoof once to indicate "no", and twice to indicate "yes".  A
sample of venous blood was drawn from each, and was subsequently tested
for the presence of antibodies to Unicorn Immunodeficiency Virus (UIV) using
a standard assay algorithm.
