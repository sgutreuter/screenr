\title{Plot ROC Curves from \code{easy_tool}-Class Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{easy_tool}(x, ..., plot_ci = TRUE, conf_level = 0.95, bootreps = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{easy_tool}.}

\item{...}{any additional arguments passed to \code{pROC::plot.roc} or
\code{pROC::lines.roc}.}

\item{plot_ci}{(logical) plot confidence intervals if \verb{TRUE}.}

\item{conf_level}{confidence level}

\item{bootreps}{the number of bootstrap replications for estimation of
confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
This function produces a plot as a side effect and (optionally)
returns a dataframe containing sensitivities, specificities and their
lower and upper confidence limits for threshold values of Pr(response = 1).

\description{
Plot ROC Curves from \code{easy_tool}-Class Objects
}
\details{
\code{plot.easy_tool} is an enhanced convenience wrapper for
\code{`pROC::plot.roc`}.  The table is useful for identifying the
minimum predicted response probabilities associated with particular
sensitivities.  The sensitivities and specificities are the coordinates at
change points in the cross-validated ROC curve, and the values of Threshold_Pr
are the values of lower bound of the predicted probability that acheives those
sensitivities and specificities.  For example, if Threshold_P = 0.002, then
classifiction as positive of all those subjects for whom the predicted response
probability is greater than or equal to 0.002 will achieve the corresponding
sensitivity and specificity at the prescribed confidence level in new
data drawn from the same distribution as the training sample.
