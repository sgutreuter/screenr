\description{
The \code{screenr} package enables construction of binary test-screening
tools.  Consider the situation where a diagnostic test for some condition is
expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal testing
would not be efficient in terms of the yield of postive results per test
performed.  Now suppose that responses to a set of simple questions may be
predictive of the condition.  Package \code{screenr} enables estimation of
thresholds for making decisions about when to test in order to screen
in/out individuals based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
estimated from an initial sample.  The choice of a particular screening
threshold is left to the user, and should be based on careful consideration
of application-specific tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity.

\details{
The high-level functions in the \code{screenr} package are:
\describe{
\item{\code{\link{binomialScreening}}}{Test-Screening Tool Based on Binomial Regression}
\item{\code{\link{getCoefficients}}}{Extract the estimated coefficients from \code{binomscreenr} objects}
\item{\code{\link{getOddsRatios}}}{Extract a dataframe containing odds ratios and their profile-likelihood confidence intervals}
\item{\code{\link{getROC}}}{Extract Receiver Operating Characteristics from Objects}
\item{\code{\link{inverseLink}}}{Inverse of binomial regression link functions}
\item{\code{\link{mebinomScreening}}}{Test-Screening Tool Based on Mixed-Effects Binomial Regression
produced by \code{binomialScreening}, \code{mebinomScreening} and \code{simpleScreening}}
\item{\code{\link{sens_spec}}}{Sensitivity and Specificity from a 2 x 2 Table}
\item{\code{\link{simpleScreening}}}{Simple Un-optimized Test-Screening Tool}
\item{\code{\link{testCounts}}}{Expected Number of Tests Required per Positive Test Result}
}

In addition, there are \code{plot}, \code{print} and \code{summary} methods
for the objects produced by \code{binomialScreening}, \code{mebinomScreening} and
\code{simpleScreening}.
