\description{
The \code{screenr} package enables construction of binary test-screening
tools.  It is designed to enable those with only a basic familiarity with
\code{R} to develop, validate and implement screening tools for diagnostic
tests.

Consider the situation where a diagnostic test for some condition is
relatively expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal
testing would not be efficient in terms of the yield of postive results per
test performed.  Now suppose that responses to a set of simple questions may
be predictive of the condition.  Package \code{screenr} enables estimation of
thresholds for making decisions about when to test in order to screen
in/out individuals based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
estimated from an initial sample.  The choice of a particular screening
threshold is left to the user, and should be based on careful consideration
of application-specific tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity.
\code{screenr} also enables easy construction of screening tools.

A tutorial is available from \code{vignette("screenr_Tutorial", package = "screenr")}.

\details{
The high-level functions in the \code{screenr} package are:
\describe{
\item{\code{\link{lasso_screenr}}}{Test-screening based on GLM path regularization
of logistic regression models}
\item{\code{\link{logreg_screenr}}}{Test-screening based maximum-likelhood estimation
of logistic regression models}
\item{\code{\link{easy_tool}}}{Easy implementation of test-screening tools}
\item{\code{\link{simple_screenr}}}{Simple un-optimized test-screening}
\item{\code{\link{rescale_to_int}}}{Rescale a strictly positive vector of real numbers
to integers}
\item{\code{\link{sens_spec_plus}}}{Sensitivity, specificity and friends}
}

There are \code{plot}, \code{print}, \code{summary}, \code{predict},
\code{get_what}, and \code{ntpp} methods for the objects produced by
\code{lasso_screenr}, \code{logreg_screenr}, \code{simple_screenr}
and \code{easy_tool}. In addition, there is a \code{coef} method for
\code{lasso_screenr} and \code{logreg_screenr} objects.
