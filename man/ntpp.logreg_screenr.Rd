\title{An S3 Method to Compute the Ratio of Total Tests to Positive Results}
\usage{
\method{ntpp}{logreg_screenr}(object, ..., type = c("cvResults", "isResults"), prev = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{logreg_screenr}-class object produced by \code{logreg_screenr}.}

\item{...}{optional arguments to \code{ntpp} methods.}

\item{type}{(character) one of \verb{"cvResults"} (the default) or
\verb{"isResults"} to specify \emph{k}-fold cross-validated or in-sample
receiver-operating characteristics, respectively.}

\item{prev}{an optional prevalence proportion for the test outcome; if missing
the prevalence is obtained from \code{object}.}
}
\value{
\code{ntpp.logreg_screenr} returns a data frame containing the
following columns:
\describe{
\item{\verb{sensitivity}}{The sensitivity (proportion) of the screener.}
\item{\verb{specificity}}{The specificity (proportion) of the screener.}
\item{\verb{ntpp}}{the number of tests required to discover
a single positive test result.}
\item{\verb{prev_untested}}{The prevalence proportion of the test
condition among those who are screened out of testing.}
}
}
\description{
\code{ntpp.logreg_screenr} computes the ratio of the total number of
tests performed per positive test result and the anticipated fraction of the
untested (those screened out of testing) who would actually test positive.
}
\details{
The anticipated number of tests required to detect a single positive
\emph{nntp} is given by
\deqn{nntp = (SeP + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)) / SeP}
where \emph{Se} is sensitivity, \emph{P} is prevalence and \emph{Sp} is
specificity. The anticipated prevalence among those screened out is given by
\deqn{Puntested = ((1 - Se)P) / ((1 - Se)P + Sp (1 - P))}
