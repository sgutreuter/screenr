\title{Expected Number of Tests Required per Positive Test Result}
\usage{
testCounts(x = NULL, prev = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame containing columns \code{sensitivity} and
\code{specificity}, or an object of class \code{binomscreenr} or
\code{simplescreenr}.}

\item{prev}{numeric proportion of the population expressing positive test
results.  \code{prev} is \emph{optional} for class \code{binomscreenr} or
\code{simplescreenr} objects, for which the default is the prevalence of
the test condition in the training sample.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\verb{sensitivity}}{The sensitivity (proportion) of the screener.}
\item{\verb{specificity}}{The specificity (proportion) of the screener.}
\item{\verb{E(Tests/Pos)}}{The expected number of tests required to discover
a single positive test result.}
\item{\verb{E(prev|untested)}}{The expected prevalence proportion of the test
condition among those who are screened out of testing.}
}
}
\description{
Compute the expected number of tests which need to be performed in order
to identify the first positive test result and the expected prevalence
among the untested given implementation of test screening options having
the specified values of sensitivity and specificity.
}
\examples{
data(unicorns)
unitool <- binomialScreening(testresult ~ Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5,
                             data = unicorns, Nfolds = 20)
testCounts(unitool)
