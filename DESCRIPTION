Description: Consider the situation where a definitive test for some condition
    is expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal testing
    would not be efficient in terms of the yield of postive results per test
    performed.  Now suppose that responses to a set of simple diagnostic
    questions or observations may be predictive of the definitive test result.
    Package screenr enables the estimation of thresholds for making decisions
    about when to perform the definitive test on newly observed subjects based
    on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) estimated from an initial sample.
    The choice of a particular screening threshold is left to the user, and
    should be based on careful consideration of application-specific tradeoffs
    between sensitivity (true positive fraction) and specificity (true negative
    fraction).
