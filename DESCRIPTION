Description: Package screenr enables easy development and validation
    of diagnostic test screening tools. It is designed to enable those
    with only a basic familiarity with R to develop, validate and
    implement screening tools for diagnostic tests. Consider the
    situation where a definitive test for some condition is relatively
    expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal
    testing would not be efficient in terms of the yield of postive
    results per test performed.  Now suppose that responses to a set
    of simple diagnostic questions or observations may be predictive
    of the definitive test result. Package screenr enables estimation
    of thresholds for making decisions about when to perform the
    definitive test on newly observed subjects based on Receiver
    Operating Characteristics (ROC) estimated from an initial sample.
    The choice of a particular screening threshold is left to the user,
    and should be based on careful consideration of application-
    specific tradeoffs between sensitivity (true positive fraction)
    and specificity (true negative fraction).
